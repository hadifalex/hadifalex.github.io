# Alex Alampounti - Data Visualisation Portfolio

I am a physicist who leans towards data science and visualisation. I have worked on multiple projects
from ultracold atomic and molecular physics, to auditory neuroscience and nonlinear dynamical systems.

This page showcases examples of my visualisation work and projects.
